# Frameworks

Custom-made JavaScript frameworks designed to experiment with core functionality and provide the foundation for friendlier implementations.  
Currently in **beta** — expect rapid iteration and breaking changes.

---

## 🚀 Overview
This repository contains experimental libraries and utilities that explore different approaches to building JavaScript frameworks. The goal is to:
- Prototype **lightweight abstractions** for DOM manipulation and rendering.
- Provide **modular building blocks** that can evolve into production-ready frameworks.
- Serve as a **learning playground** for new ideas in frontend architecture.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **`canvasLib/`** – Utilities for working with HTML5 Canvas, including rendering helpers and abstractions.  
- **`jAbsolute/`** – A DOM manipulation library focused on absolute positioning and layout control.  
- **`LICENSE`** – Open-source license details.  
- **`README.md`** – Project documentation (you’re reading it).
